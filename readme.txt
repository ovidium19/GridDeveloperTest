How to open the project:

The project was built with NetBeans 8.2. It is written in Java Programming Language.
If you have NetBeans 8.2 installed, simply open the project from the IDE.
If you have a different JAVA IDE, simply start a new Project and move all my Java files to that new Project and name the package accordingly.
In NetBeans, there is a Run button at the top (Shortcut F6)


The main method is in the GridDeveloper.java file
